    Returns the input data with *replaced* data that is crafted specifically to
    cause a poisoning dictionary attack, where all features are set to one.

    Inputs:
    - features: N * D Numpy matrix of binary values (0 and 1)
        with N: the number of training examples
        and  D: the number of features for each example
    - labels:   N * 1 Numpy vector of binary values (-1 and 1)
    - percentage_samples_poisoned: float between 0 and 1
        percentage of the dataset under the attacker's control

    Outputs:
    - X: poisoned features
    - Y: poisoned labels
