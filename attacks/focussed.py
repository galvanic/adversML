Implementation of the focussed attack, see description in the `apply` function.

TODO A lot of shared code with the ham attack (obviously since focussed attack
     is the ham attack where the only ham is the target email) - refactor
TODO see what I said in `select_using_MI`, take into account absent features too

    Returns indices of the most salient features for the ham class, using a
    mutual information score between feature values and class label, and
    from the highest scoring, filtering the ones that are most present
    in spam relatively. This makes sense since we then use these indices
    to choose which features to turn on in emails

    TODO or I could keep all the highest MI score features, and if more
         present in ham, I set it to 1, else I set it to zero
         requires extra array somewhere though
         Thinking about it, this is already what is happening since the ham
         malicious instances already have all their features set to zero
         (but this proportion of features controlled by the attacker could
         vary ? depending on attacket's dataset knowledge ? ie. malicious
         instances' feature values could be initialised randomly, or drawn from a
         spammy dicstribution to mimick an email that still has a malicious
         potential (although this isn't necessary since we are doing a poison,
         not evasion attack); then compare this to initialised with 0s or with 1s
