Implementation of the focussed attack, see description in the `apply` function.

TODO A lot of shared code with the ham attack (obviously since focussed attack
     is the ham attack where the only ham is the target email) - refactor
TODO see what I said in `select_using_MI`, take into account absent features too

    Returns the input data with *replaced* data that is crafted specifically to
    cause a poisoning focussed attack, where features of the contaminating emails
    are selected because they are indicative of a specific email (ie. attack is
    *focussed* on that email)

    Inputs:
    - features: N * D Numpy matrix of binary values (0 and 1)
        with N: the number of training examples
        and  D: the number of features for each example
    - labels:   N * 1 Numpy vector of binary values (-1 and 1)
    - percentage_samples_poisoned: float between 0 and 1
        percentage of the dataset under the attacker's control
    - percentage_features_poisoned: float between 0 and 1
        percentage of the features under the attacker's control
    - feature_selection_method: string
    - threshold: percentile of features to keep

    Outputs:
    - X: N * D poisoned features
    - Y: N * 1 poisoned labels
