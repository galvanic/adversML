    Returns the input data with *added* data that is crafted specifically to
    cause a poisoning ham attack, where features of the contaminating emails
    are selected because they are indicative of the ham class.

    Inputs:
    - features: N * D Numpy matrix of binary values (0 and 1)
        with N: the number of training examples
        and D:        the number of features for each example
    - labels:   N * 1 Numpy vector of binary values (-1 and 1)
    - percentage_samples_poisoned: float between 0 and 1
        percentage of the dataset under the attacker's control
    - percentage_features_poisoned: float between 0 and 1
        percentage of the features under the attacker's control
    - feature_selection_method: string

    Outputs:
    - X: poisoned features
    - Y: poisoned labels
